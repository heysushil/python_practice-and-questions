# Python Classes and Objects

# Python is an object oriented programming language.
# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.


# Create a Class
# To create a class, use the keyword class:


# Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:



# The __init__() Function
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:


# Object Methods


# The self Parameter


# Modify Object Properties


# Delete Object Properties


# Delete Objects


# The pass Statement
